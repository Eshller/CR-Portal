The work your NGO is doing is great for young Indian minds to explore new possibilities and reach out to achieve far more goals and succeed. There are thousands and hundreds of students like me who are intelligent; those who got straight A's throughout their school years and even secured a perfect 10 CGPa in their board exams but couldn't make it to their parents' expectations of clearing the JEE mains examination and landed in an average college. These students, though they perform excellently well there, just need a chance,an opportunity to show that they are brilliant and can excel wherever they go and whatever challenge they are given, they will always be up for it. In such circumstances, many lose hope and just blame their situation by saying that their college isn't good enough and can't provide them with a good placement, so they don't have any other option. While there are others who reach out and explore the endless possibilities the world has to offer them, they don't rely on excuses and take the benefit of what is at hand and perform their best. People studying at any college, doing any job, and of any age, especially women, are given a new ray of hope if they are shown the right path, properly guided, and given the necessary investment and infrastructure. If given the proper support from a trusted organisation like IIT, the country will be capable of producing lakhs and thousands of successful Indian-born startups in no time. As well as, it will help in reshaping the lives of many people who have lost faith and had a blurry future and thought that they wouldn't be earning enough for their families.
